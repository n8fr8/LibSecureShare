    In August 2013 a severe bug was found in Android's SecureRandom implementation. This affected all
    versions of Android up to and including 4.3.

    Cacheword will apply the suggested fix for this, unless you tell it not to.

    The only reason to disable this is if (1) You already apply the fixes in your application or
    (2) you are only running on Android > 4.3.

    It is suggested that you apply the fixes yourself in onCreate of your Application class, to ensure
    the PRNG is fixed as soon as possible. If you do this, change this value to false.

        Iteration Count:  the minimum iteration count value used in the PBKDF2 key hashing step.

                          The larger this value the more secure the user's password will be against
                          offline cracking attempts, but the longer the unlocking process will take.
                          The ideal number is one which results in approximately 1 sec of unlock time
                          on the device, however this changes from device to device due to varying hardware.

        Auto Calibrate:   Cacheword will attempt to calculate the best iteration count for the device at
                          runtime using an adaptive algorithim that takes less than a second.

                          If auto_calibrate is set to false, then Cacheword will use the minimum value in all cases.

                          If auto_calibrate is set to true and the detected iteration count (from an existing
                          installation) is lower than the new minimum, a new calibration will be performed.
